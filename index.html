                  Hi!, my name is Qurram, and I&rsquo;ve been into computers
                  since my dad first got a Pentium 4 system in our house. That
                  computer opened up multiple vast worlds for me, from the crude
                  beauty of the thousands of Flash games people made, to the
                  intricacies in the internal components, I was enraptured. And
                  thus began my interest in building things for computers. As I
                  matured, this interest evolved into more abstract ideas,
                  specifically those of the human conscious, and how you could
                  implement something so vague get complicated into a computer
                  system. My first experience with programming was in the world
                  of web development, which continues to have a soft spot in my
                  heart. I&rsquo;ve had a lot of fun building my own blazing
                  fast corner of the web, with pixel-perfect UIs and no
                  meaningless noise. I absolutely love learning and
                  experimenting with new things in software development.

                          This was the result of my life-long dream of creating
                          an online multiplayer Pokemon battle simulator. The
                          browser game focused on scalability, and was made as
                          part of coursework for my Enterprise Software
                          Architecture course.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          I worked on the architecture for the entire game, and
                          learnt a lot about good code practices and their
                          importance when it comes to making complex software.
                          Programmed both the server (using Node) and the
                          front-end (using React), both pretty much entirely
                          from scratch. I always wanted to learn what a
                          multiplayer game server looked like on the inside, and
                          sure, the scale of this was nowhere near any AAA game
                          server, but I&#39;m glad I atleast got a peek.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          The game was able to manage the peak load of 100
                          concurrent players quite comfortably. This project was
                          also my first attempt at implemented a CI/CD pipeline,
                          which was yet another &#39;oh wow this is
                          convenient&#39; moment in my life as a developer.

                        <li>
                          With the spread of COVID-19, there was an astronomical
                          rise in the number of communities dedicated to trading
                          in the stock market, as a direct result of people
                          being stuck at home and needing guidance at something
                          they hadn&#39;t done before. With the rise of these
                          communities, there was the inevitable rise of the pump
                          and dump parties, and this bot was created partially
                          as a way for people to guard themselves against such
                          parties.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          The bot tracks indivial trade-wise performance for
                          every member in the community and displays a graphical
                          representation on demand.

                        <li>
                          The second reason for this was to eventually gather
                          enough data and run a sentiment analysis on the
                          messages posted each day in the server and determine
                          wether the overall community market sentiment was
                          bearish or bullish. This is still a work in progress.

                      <p>
                        I served as the Head of the Erudite, Mahindra
                        University's literary and debate club, for 2 years. I've
                        always enjoyed (certain kinds) of literature, but the
                        main reason I joined this club was because of my love
                        for public speaking. I enjoy keeping audiences engaged,
                        and coming up with new and interesting ways to do so. As
                        part of my responsibilities as club head, I handled the
                        logistics for multiple inter and intra college events,
                        which was a huge learning opportunity for me. I also
                        lead contingents from Mahindra University to other
                        colleges to participate in multiple competitions.
